# Run React-Native App with Expo

1. **Install Expo CLI globally**:

   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Navigate into your project directory**:

   ```
   cd frontend-mobile
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```
   npx expo
   ```

   This command will start the development server for your Expo project. It will also open a new tab in your default web browser with the Expo DevTools.

4. **Running on a web browser**:

   - After running `expo start`, you can press `w` to open your app in a web browser.

5. **Running on a device**:
   - **Physical device**: Install the Expo Go app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). Then, scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo DevTools using the Expo Go app on your device.

6. **Navigation on App.js**:
    ```
    npm install @react-navigation/stack
    ```

These commands should work seamlessly with npm. Ensure you have `Node.js` installed, as npm comes bundled with Node.js.
